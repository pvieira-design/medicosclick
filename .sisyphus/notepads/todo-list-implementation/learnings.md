## Public Candidatura Form
- Created public layout and pages for doctor application form.
- Used `@tanstack/react-form` with `zod` validation.
- Integrated with `trpc.onboarding.submitCandidatura`.
- Implemented dynamic list for specialties.
- Handled conditional fields (comoConheceuOutro).
- Skipped file upload implementation (UI only) due to backend constraints.
- Used `lucide-react` for icons.
- Followed design guidelines (clean, no sidebar).
